# Doppler Effect Simulation

An interactive simulation of the Doppler Effect, built with [SceneryStack](https://github.com/sceneryStack). This simulation allows users to explore how the frequency of sound waves changes when there is relative motion between a sound source and an observer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/veillette/dopplerEffectPhET.git
cd dopplerEffectPhET
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

4. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Controls

### Mouse Controls

- Click and drag the red source or blue observer to move them
- The connecting line shows the distance between source and observer

### Keyboard Controls

- `S`: Select source
- `O`: Select observer
- Arrow keys: Move selected object
- Space: Pause/Resume simulation
- `R`: Reset simulation
- `H`: Toggle help display
- `+/-`: Adjust emitted frequency
- `,/.`: Adjust sound speed
- `1-6`: Load preset scenarios
  - `1`: Source approaching observer
  - `2`: Source receding from observer
  - `3`: Observer approaching source
  - `4`: Observer receding from source
  - `5`: Same direction motion
  - `6`: Perpendicular motion

## Physics Model

The simulation uses the Doppler Effect formula:

```
f' = f * (v - v‚Çí) / (v - v‚Çõ)
```

where:

- f' is the observed frequency
- f is the emitted frequency
- v is the speed of sound
- v‚Çí is the observer's velocity component along the line of sight
- v‚Çõ is the source's velocity component along the line of sight
