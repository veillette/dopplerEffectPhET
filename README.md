# Doppler Effect Simulation

An interactive simulation of the Doppler Effect, built with [SceneryStack](https://github.com/sceneryStack). This simulation allows users to explore how the frequency of sound waves changes when there is relative motion between a sound source and an observer.

## Controls

### Mouse Controls

- Click and drag the green source or purple observer to move them and control their velocity
- Drag the microphone icon to listen to the sound

### Keyboard Controls

- `S`: Select source
- `O`: Select observer
- Arrow keys: Move selected object
- Space: Pause/Resume simulation
- `R`: Reset simulation
- `T`: Toggle motion trails
- `M`: Toggle microphone
- `H`: Toggle help display
- `+/-`: Adjust emitted frequency
- `,/.`: Adjust sound speed
- `0-6`: Load preset scenarios
  - `0`: Free Play
  - `1`: Source approaching observer
  - `2`: Source receding from observer
  - `3`: Observer approaching source
  - `4`: Observer receding from source
  - `5`: Same direction motion
  - `6`: Perpendicular motion

## Physics Model

The simulation uses the Doppler Effect formula:

```
f' = f * (v - v‚Çí) / (v - v‚Çõ)
```

where:

- f' is the observed frequency
- f is the emitted frequency
- v is the speed of sound
- v‚Çí is the observer's velocity component along the line of sight
- v‚Çõ is the source's velocity component along the line of sight
